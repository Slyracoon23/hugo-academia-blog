## My name is **Earl Potters** and I'm a **Computer Science** undergraduate specializing in **Robotics**

Did you know that the first use of the word robot was in the 1920 play _R.U.R.:_ _Rossum’s Universal Robots_ by Czech writer Karel Čapek. In the play, the robots overthrow their human creators.
