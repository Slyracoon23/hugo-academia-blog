## I'm a **Computer Scientist** specializing in **Blockchain**

 I started my crypto journey in May of 2021. Previously I had been going to school at the university of Boulder Colorado doing robotics which included controls and some reinforcement learning.  Since winter of 2021, I attended and completed the Consenys Bootcamp where I created my own blockchain Gwent game.  

After that I attend EthDenver, where my team and I won the Balancer NFT/Defi bounty! Since then I have met incredible people and now do freelance work for CityDAO. 

I am excited to see the blockchain space grow and see where it takes us in the future.
